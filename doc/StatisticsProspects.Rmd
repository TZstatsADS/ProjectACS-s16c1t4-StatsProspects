#Introduction

So everyone here has spent a good amount of time studying statistics. But what happens when we leave school? Will we get a job? Where will we live? And besides these trends, who are our peers? Where are they from, and what industries are they going into?

As most statisticians know, we can't answer any of those questions without looking at the data! So, utilizing the ACS 2013 dataset, Group 4 decided to look at some trends of those who graduated with a statistics degree (whether it was a Bachelor's, Master's or PhD) and compared it to some of our academic rivals... er... cohorts, in Computer Science, Finance, and Mathematics.

##Establishing Libraries

First things first, these were the packages and libraries we needed to use for our project. 

```{r, message = F}
library(dplyr)
library(data.table)
library(ggplot2)
library(choroplethr)
library(choroplethrMaps)
library(Hmisc)
```

##Reading In The Data
Due to the large size of the data set, the group decided to maximize efficiency by narrowing the scope of the variables we looked at. Thus, we read in a select amount of column variables, as well as their respective weights.

The variables we selected to look into (and then decide which ones were most interesting to look at in a depper level) for each individual with a statistics, finance, computer science or mathematics background were wage, state of living, age, citizenship, class of work, education level, gender, industry recode, place of work, employment status, and of course, field of degree.

```{r}
cols <- c("WAGP", "ST", "AGEP", "CIT", "COW", "SCHL", "SEX" , "FOD1P","INDP" , "NAICSP" , "POWSP" , "ESR", "PWGTP")
pusa <- fread("~/Desktop/ss13pusa.csv", select = cols)
pusb <- fread("~/Desktop/ss13pusb.csv", select = cols)
pus <- subset(rbind(pusa, pusb))
write.csv(pus, file = "finaldata.csv",row.names = FALSE)
```

##Data Cleaning
Now that we have the data read in, we need to clean it up to ensure good statistical analysis.
```{r}
#Cleaning of Data
pus <- pus[pus$FOD1P == 3700 | pus$FOD1P == 3701 | pus$FOD1P == 3702 | pus$FOD1P == 2102 | pus$FOD1P == 6212 | pus$FOD1P == 6207 | pus$FOD1P == 6202]

#Renaming of field of degree for clarity in understanding
pus$FOD1P[pus$FOD1P == 3700 | pus$FOD1P == 3701] <- "MATH"
pus$FOD1P[pus$FOD1P == 6207] <- "FINANCE"
pus$FOD1P[pus$FOD1P == 3702 | pus$FOD1P == 6212 | pus$FOD1P == 6202] <- "STATISTICS"
pus$FOD1P[pus$FOD1P == 2102] <- "COMPUTER SCIENCE"
pus$FOD1P <- factor(pus$FOD1P)

##Renaming of Education Level
pus$SCHL[pus$SCHL == 21] <- "Bachelor's Degree"
pus$SCHL[pus$SCHL == 22] <- "Master's Degree"
pus$SCHL[pus$SCHL == 23] <- "Professional degree"
pus$SCHL[pus$SCHL == 24] <- "Doctorate degree"
pus$SCHL <- factor(pus$SCHL)

#Renaming of Gender
pus$SEX[pus$SEX == 1] <- "Male"
pus$SEX[pus$SEX == 2] <- "Female"
pus$SEX <- factor(pus$SEX)

#Renaming of Employment Status
pus$ESR[pus$ESR == 1 | pus$ESR == 4] <- "Employed"
pus$ESR[pus$ESR == 2 | pus$ESR == 5] <- "Employed/Not at work"
pus$ESR[pus$ESR == 3 ] <- "Unemployed"
pus$ESR[pus$ESR == "NA" | pus$ESR == 6] <- "Not in labor force"
pus$ESR <- factor(pus$ESR)

pus$COW <- factor(pus$COW)
levels(pus$COW) <- c("Private profit", "Private non-profit", "Local government", "State government", "Federal government", "Self-employed", "Self-employed", "Working without pay", "Unemployed")

```
 
##Incorporating Weights

As I am sure we are all familiar with, ACS uses weights that need to be incorporated. We provide the following example of how we incorporated the weights:

```{r}
library(data.table)
mydata1<-fread("~/Desktop/ss13pusa.csv")
mydata2<-fread("~/Desktop/ss13pusb.csv")

#Combine the two separate datasets
mydata<- subset(rbind(mydata1, mydata2))

#Select the Columns we wish to use in our analysis
which(colnames(mydata)=="pwgtp1")
cols_1<- c("WAGP", "ST", "AGEP", "CIT", "COW", "SCHL", "SEX" , "FOD1P","INDP" , "NAICSP" , "POWSP" , "ESR","PWGTP")
pus_new<-select(mydata,one_of(cols_1),204:283)
pus_new<-as.data.frame(pus_new)

```

##Using Weights in Summary Statistics
```{r}
#How to calulate the mean and standard error of Income level using weights utilizing the "Survey" package:
library(survey)

df1<-svrepdesign(variables=pus_new[,1:13], 
repweights=pus_new[,14:93], type="BRR",combined.weights=TRUE,
weights=pus_new$PWGTP)
summary(df1)
svymean(~ WAGP,df1, na.rm = T)

#What if We only want to know the SE and Mean of Statistics Income?

pus_new$FOD1P[pus_new$FOD1P == 3702 | pus_new$FOD1P == 6212 | pus_new$FOD1P == 6202]<-"Statistics"
df<-subset(pus_new, pus_new$FOD1P=="Statistics")
df2<-svrepdesign(variables=df[,1:13], 
repweights=df[,14:93], type="BRR",combined.weights=TRUE,
weights=df$PWGTP)
summary(df2)
svymean(~ WAGP,df2, na.rm = T)
```

##Looking At Initial Trends
To see what we are working with, we first looked at some basic plots to understand how the data's shape and distribution fell.

First, we wanted to see who was in the field of study. We looked into counts of major, controlling for gender.

###Major by Gender

![Major By Gender](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/cycle1-4/blob/master/figs/Rplot.jpeg)

```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(pus, aes(x = FOD1P, y = PWGTP, fill = FOD1P)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + facet_grid(. ~ SEX) +  labs(x="Majors",title="Major by Gender") + ylim(0, 1000000) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9, angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))
```
We can see that males are much more represented in all of the fields. 

###Education Level by Major
![Edu Level](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/cycle1-4/blob/master/figs/Rplot02.jpeg)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(pus, aes(x = FOD1P, y = PWGTP, fill = FOD1P)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + facet_grid(. ~ SCHL) + labs(x="Majors",title = "Education level by majors") + ylim(0, 1000000) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9, angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))
```
The bachelor's degree is the most popular degree, following with the master's degree. A math degree is the mode for PhD's, Master's, and Professional degrees, but is much below in frequency for Bachelor's Degrees. This "flip" in the trend is interesting, and one could extrapolate to see if those who studied math needed a higher degree to find work/pursue their passions. To try to shed some light on that, we then looked at Employment status.

###Employment status by major
![Employment Status](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/cycle1-4/blob/master/figs/Rplot01.jpeg)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(pus, aes(x = FOD1P, y = PWGTP, fill= FOD1P)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") + facet_grid(. ~ ESR) + labs(x="Majors",title = "Employment status by majors") + ylim(0, 1000000) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9, angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))
```
The good news for all of us is that most of us are employed! The next most popular options across the board is "Not in Labor Force", which constututes maternity leave, and similar situations where the subject was taking a leave from work (but had work to return to).

But now, where do we find work?

###Class of work by major
![Work Sector](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/cycle1-4/blob/master/figs/Rplot03.jpeg)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(pus, aes(x = COW, y = PWGTP, fill= COW)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity")  + facet_grid(. ~ FOD1P) + labs(x="Majors",title = "Class of Work by Major") + ylim(0, 1000000) + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 9, angle = 45, hjust = 1, vjust = 1))
```
The large majority of individuals across all examined areas of study were employed in the private sector. Usually, we would remove NA values in our study, but left them in for this plot to highlight that a large proportion of individuals responded NA, which is interesting to think about, becuase what constitutes "NA" was unclear in the ACS research report.

So the good news is, it is likely we will get jobs. But no need to be shy, the next question on our mind is... how much will we get paid?

Thus, we examined the range of income by major for each sector, and produced the following plot:

###Wage vs Major
![Wage by Major](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/cycle1-4/blob/master/figs/Rplot04.jpeg)
```{r, echo=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(value = pus$WAGP, category =  pus$FOD1P, weight = pus$PWGTP)

ggplot(df, aes(x = category, y = value, weight = weight)) +
geom_boxplot(aes(weight = NULL), width=0.6, colour = "#3366FF") +
stat_summary( fun.y ="wtd.mean", geom ="point",
shape = 23, size = 3, fill = c(1:4)) +  ylim(0, 200000) + labs(title = "Wages by Majors")
```
Good news is, us statisticians don't need to worry!  Median income falls around $65,000, which is higher than both finance and math majors, and only slightly lower than CompSci.

But now we face one more level of concern. Just in this class we have a variety of education levels. As we saw earlier, Math students needed to get higher degrees (and their salaries weren't as high as ours!) Do we need higher degrees too?

##But what does that mean for us?
![Major By Gender](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/cycle1-4/blob/master/figs/Rplot05.jpeg)
```{r}
df2 <- data.frame(value = pus$WAGP[pus$FOD1P == "STATISTICS"], category =  pus$SCHL[pus$FOD1P == "STATISTICS"], weight = pus$PWGTP[pus$FOD1P == "STATISTICS"])

ggplot(df2, aes(x = category, y = value, weight = weight)) +
geom_boxplot(aes(weight = NULL), width=0.6, colour = "#3366FF") +
stat_summary( fun.y ="wtd.mean", geom ="point", shape = 23, size = 3, fill = c(1:4)) + ylim(0, 200000) + labs(title = "Stat_wages by Education levels")
```
PhD students have the highest median and average income, around $80,000. The trend does show that the farther one progresses from a bachelors, the more one makes (excluding professional degrees). However, the median 50% of masters students only make slightly more than the median 50% of bachelors students. 

But of course with all these studies and graphs and high hopes, we wouldnt be real statisticians if we didnt delve into a finer quantitaive granularity.

#But now we must ask... is this statistically significant?
```{r}
library(weights)
S_wage<-pus$WAGP[pus$FOD1P == "STATISTICS"]
weight<- pus$PWGTP[pus$FOD1P == "STATISTICS"]
S_edul<-pus$SCHL[pus$FOD1P == "STATISTICS"]
```

At first glance, people with higher education level are likely to earn more.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
by(S_wage, S_edul, summary)
```

We then ran a chi-squared test and produced the following:
```{r}
chisq.test(table(S_wage,S_edul))
#With weights
wtd.chi.sq(S_wage, S_edul, weight=weight)
```
The Chi-squared test revealed a statistically signicant assocation (p=0) between wage and education level in the field of statistics. So, we should keep pursuing those higher degrees not only for the advancement of personal knowledge, but for higher wages aswell.

So now that we have established that we will have a job, we will make some money, where will we end up? We conclude with a spatial examination of where we will work.

##Where are we Working?
###Mapping Just Statistics Majors
![Location](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/cycle1-4/blob/master/figs/ONLY_STAT.png)
```{r}
junk <- data.frame(tapply(pus$PWGTP[pus$FOD1P == "STATISTICS"], pus$POWSP[pus$FOD1P == "STATISTICS"] , FUN = sum))
junk <- junk[-c(51:52),]
junk <- data.frame(junk)

junk$region <- c("AL","AZ","AR","CA","CO","CT","DE","DC","FL","GA","HI","ID","IL","IN","IA","KS","KY","LA","ME","MD","MA","MI","MN","MS","MO","MT","NE","NV","NH","NJ","NM","NY","NC","ND","OH","OK","OR","PA","RI","SC","SD","TN","TX","UT","VT","VA","WA","WV","WI","WY")

data(state.regions)
statenames <- data.frame(cbind(state.regions[,1],state.regions[,2]))
names(statenames) <- c("region2", "region")
junk2 <- merge(junk,statenames, by="region")
names(junk2) <- c("region2", "value", "region")
junk2$region2 <- tolower(as.character(junk2$region2))
junk2$region <- tolower(as.character(junk2$region))
png("ONLY_STAT.png", width=800)
state_choropleth(junk2)
dev.off()

summary(junk)
```

As you can see, there aren't many of us to begin with (26,199 is the highest count in each state), but there are at least a few in each state. The state with the fewest statisticians is Vermont, with 61 reported people. The highest reported state is Texas, with 26,000. The median amount of statisticians per state is 3592, which is less than the computed average, which was 4901.


#Location at a Higher Granularity
![Location Pt 2](https://github.com/TZstatsADS/cycle1-4/blob/master/figs/zoom_out.png)
```{r}
state_choropleth(junk2,
                 title      = "Stat Major vs Place of Work",
                 legend     = "Population",
                 num_colors = 1,
                 zoom       = c("california", "new york", "texas","georgia","florida","illinois","pennsylvania"))
```
These are the states with the highest number of statisticians. 


#Conclusion

Be proud to be a statistician (especially a female statistician) becuase though they are underrepresnted in both gender and field of study in proportion to other similar fields of study, the employment rate is high, and the salary is competitive! Statisticians can be found all across the country (especially in states with major cities and urban centers), and hold up well against our Finance, CompSci, and Math coutnerparts. 

#The Next Steps
If someone wanted to pursure this further with their own survery, an examination of the relationship with where statisticans live would be very interesting, espeically since it is so skewed across the country. The group theorized that the states that had large numbers were also states with big urban centers, prominent universities, and hubs for tech and government work, but a formal analysis would need to be done.
